# Getting Started with Create React App with Docker basic configuration

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Docker

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker build . -t [your-new-container-name]`

[your-new-container-name] is your name e.g. my-new-container.
Use kebab case instead of camel case for name.

Creates docker container with React application.

### `docker image ls`

Checks your last created container - you shuld see that container as first from list (optionally).

### `docker run [your-new-container-name] `

Runs docker container.

After these steps you should have new ran docker container with your React application.

You can also log in to your container by following commands:

### `docker container ps`

After running above command please copy your container ID and use in below command.

### `docker exec -it [your_copied_container_id] sh`

After these steps, you are inside React app project as in the local environment on your local machine. And you can run npm start and other commands what you want.

### `exit`
Log out from container.
